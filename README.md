# Strings

## AIM-
Perform programs on strings.

## Software Used-
VS Code


### Algorithm 1: Concatenate Strings


Start Program.

Input:

Take two strings, str1 and str2.

Combine str1 and str2 into a single string.

Print or return the concatenated string.

End Program.

 

### Algorithm 2: Reverse a String


Take a string str.

Set an empty string reversed.

Append the character to reversed.

Print or return the reversed string.

End Program.



### Algorithm 3: Check if a String is a Palindrome



Set start index to 0.

Set end index to length of str - 1.

If str[start] is not equal to str[end]:

The string is not a palindrome. Return false and exit.

Increment start and decrement end.

If the loop completes without mismatches, the string is a palindrome. Return true.

Print or return true or false based on the palindrome check.



**Conclusion**

In this experiment we performed strings
